    I lead the bioinformatics research for our clinical-research immunology group in Europe's second largest teaching hospital; St. James's, University of Leeds (second to the London multi-hospital network). This requires 30% functional labwork and 70% bioinformatic work. Experienced in genomics, whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, deep-parallel sequencing for somatic variant discovery. I have worked on large dataset analysis with the Genomics England 100,000 genomes project (author of the first paper from the NIHRBR- RD PID network). My work includes routine and esoteric analysis, population genetics, data processing and storage. Experience with HiSeq 3000, Miseq, ABI Sanger sequencing, WES and custom library design and preparation.
