    The research includes the application of iPSC differentiated endothelial cells (ECs) with the aim of rescuing the abnormal vasculature phenotype seen in patients with diabetic retinopathy, familial exudative retinopathy, Coats disease and many more detrimental vascular diseases. Differentiated ECs are introduced into a vasculopathy zebrafish animal model to establish their ability to integrate into the host vasculature and rescue part or the entire abnormal phenotype. My second research project focuses on defining the genes and pathways underlying the process of degeneration and regeneration of cryo-injury zebrafish model using RNA-seq data.
